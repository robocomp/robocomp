# Maintaining your own repository of components in GitHub

We recommend that you create a repository for your own components (i.e. *mycomponents* directory in the example below) in your GitHub account (or other similar site) and pull/clone it in *~/robocomp/components* whenever yo need it. 

This tutorial complements [Creating my First Component using robocompdsl](robocompdsl.md). 

## Creating the repository

For example, if your GitHub account is *myaccount*, first log in with your browser and create a new repository named *mycomponents*. If you need help you can follow these instructions: 

https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/
    
We suggest that you write down a short description of what your component does in the `README.md` file.

# Cleaning the generated folder from the Robocomp DSL

Cleaning up the binary and generated files in *myfirstcomp* is important. Note that this is not necessary if you upload the component to the repo just after creating it with DSLEditor and before you type *cmake .*. Following are example commands for doing it:

```bash
cd ~/robocomp/components/mycomponents/myfirstcomp
make clean
sudo rm -r CMakeFiles
rm CMakeCache.txt
rm cmake_install.cmake
rm Makefile
rm *.kd*
rm src/moc*
sudo rm -r src/CMakeFiles
rm src/cmake_install.cmake
rm src/Makefile
```

Now add your new `mycomponents` folder to your GitHub account:

```bash
cd ~/robocomp/components/mycomponents
git init
git remote add origin "https://github.com/myaccount/mycomponents.git"
git add mycomponents
git push -u origin master
```

You can go now to GitHub and make changes to your repository directly from your browser. As well as share your components with other RoboComp enthusiasts!
