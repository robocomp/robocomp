## Running the Script from the terminal

1. Open your terminal window in your Ubuntu operating system.

**Pro Tip:** Some Terminal Basics --> With the `cd` command you can change your place to other folders. With `ls` you can see the files in your current place.

3. Make it executable with this command: `sudo chmod +x installScript.sh`. It's probably going to prompt you for your password.

4. Now run it with this command: `./installScript.sh`.

## Answering the Script Questions

When you run the script, it's going to ask you several questions, prompting you with several y/n (Yes/No) options.

Depending on your downloading speed and how powerful your processor is, the installation process can take from a few minutes to almost an hour. 

**Pro Tip:** if you make a mistake in the process, you can escape the script with `Ctrl` + `C`.
